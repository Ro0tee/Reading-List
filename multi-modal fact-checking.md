## Summary
This three papers are highly correlated. Firstly, paper 1 creates a new image caption for a news image without considering the factuality of caption generation. Based on the dataset of paper 1, paper 2 generates captions for each news image in an automated fashion by using CLIP. Further paper 3 constructs an open-domain image caption datasets based on the dataset of paper 2.
